		<li id="title"><tag class="tag">Who is Socrates? </tag>Socrates was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher.</li>
		<li id="tribute-info"><tag class="tag">Socratic Problem: </tag>He authored no texts, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers composing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon.</li>
		<li id="tribute-info"><tag class="tag">Plato's Portrayal: </tag>Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, from which Socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology.</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Early Life: </tag>His date of birth is within the period of years ranging 470 to 469 BC, or within a range of 469 to 468 BC</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Military Service: </tag>In the monologue of the Apology, Socrates states he was active for Athens in the battles of Amphipolis, Delium, and Potidaea.</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Arrest of Leon: </tag>Socrates and four others were summoned to the Tholos. However, Socrates chose not to go to Salamis as he was expected to, because he did not want to be involved in what he considered a crime and despite the risk of subsequent retribution from the tyrants.</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Trial: </tag>In 399 BC, Socrates went on trial and was subsequently found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety (asebeia, "not believing in the gods of the state"). As punishment, he was sentenced to death</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Death: </tag>Socrates was instructed to walk around until his legs felt numb. After he lay down, the man who administered the poison pinched his foot and Socrates could no longer feel his legs. The numbness slowly crept up his body until it reached his heart.</li>
		<li><tag class="tag">Last Words: </tag>Socrates's last words are thought to be possibly sincere (J. Crooks 1998), or possibly ironic, in the sense that he was about to be "cured" of the sickness of mortality.</li>
